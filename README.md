# COVID-19 Data Scraping and Analysis*

This project focuses on scraping COVID-19 data from various websites using Python, performing data cleaning, and analyzing the data using Power BI.

**Project Overview:**
- Utilized BeautifulSoup library in Python for web scraping to extract COVID-19 data from different websites.
- Scraped data includes total number of deaths, total cases, new deaths, new cases, active cases, and critical cases from various countries and continents.
- Transformed the scraped data into CSV files using Pandas for further analysis.
- Uploaded the CSV files to Power BI for visualization and analysis purposes.
  
**Technologies Used:**
- Python: Utilized BeautifulSoup for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation and conversion.
- Power BI: Used for data visualization and analysis, including data cleaning and visualization of COVID-19 trends.
  
**Project Objectives:**
- Gather real-time COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Analyze and visualize COVID-19 trends, including total cases, deaths, and active cases across different countries and continents.
  
**Future Enhancements:**
